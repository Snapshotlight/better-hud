If you encounter a game crash, please do as many of these as possible:
- [ ] Ensure you are running the latest version of the mod and can reproduce the problem
- [ ] Attach the full crash report, including mod list (from `.minecraft/crash-reports`)
- [ ] Attach your configuration file from Better HUD and any mods you think may be relevant to the problem
- [ ] Provide a description of what you were doing/looking at/holding when the game crashed
- [ ] If you think you know the cause, please include it

If you encounter a bug/visual glitch that doesn't end the game, you can force a crash by holding `F3+C` for 10 seconds. Then upload your crash report as normal.

**Please upload your crash report/configurations as attachments on GitHub, not copy/paste.**

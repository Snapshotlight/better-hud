Better HUD gives you heaps of customization options for the in-game HUD: move around vanilla widgets, add or remove new widgets, and configure it all to your liking! Better HUD features a powerful positioning system to get everything just right, and plenty of tweaks for each widget.

## Settings
To open the settings menu, the default key binding is **U**. This can be changed just like any other key, from **Options... Controls... Miscellaneous**. From the menu you have control over everything on screen, down to the crosshair. Enable or disable widgets, or click the options button for more options and positioning.

## Configure Vanilla
In `beta-1.4` and later (check the CurseForge project page!), vanilla elements can be moved and configured. Move around your hotbar, your health and hunger bars, and everything else. You can even turn off your health bar for extra-hard mode!

## Widgets
Better HUD has a grand total of **40** configurable widgets. There's an on-screen compass, armor status, item pickup tracker, blood splatters and many more. Mix and match to create your perfect HUD. Check the full list below:

## Error Reporting
Comments are disabled because they are not a place to post crash reports. If your game crashes or has a bug, please follow these steps:

- Ensure you are running the latest version of the mod and can reproduce the problem
- **Ensure the problem is actually related to this mod:** crash reports (excluding forced ones, see below) must mention the modid `betterhud` outside of the mod list. Look for a line that starts with `at jobicade.betterhud.`
- Include the full crash report, including mod list (from `.minecraft/crash-reports/`)
- Include your configuration file from Better HUD and any mods you think may be relevant to the problem
- Provide a description of what you were doing/looking at/holding when the game crashed
- If you think you know the cause, please include it
- Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mccreery/better-hud/issues) to see if your issue has been solved or reported already
- If not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/mccreery/better-hud/issues/new) with all the information you gathered.

If you encounter a bug/visual glitch that doesn't end the game, you can force a crash by holding <kbd>F3</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for 10 seconds. Then provide your crash report as normal.

## F.A.Q.
- **Q:** Can I use this mod in a modpack? \
  **A:** Yes, and I thank those who use CurseForge since it counts towards my total downloads and helps boost the mod!
- **Q:** Where should I make suggestions? \
  **A:** The [issue tracker](https://github.com/mccreery/better-hud/issues) is the best place to do so, and you can add the "suggestion" label to make it clear. Suggestions about updating to Minecraft version X are likely to go ignored.
- **Q:** My favourite server banned Better HUD. Can you make a version without X and Y/with a different name? \
  **A:** No. This mod has one standard release and the only likely variants would be for different Minecraft versions.
- **Q:** Why? I really like this mod and I want to play it! \
  **A:** I appreciate the support, but neither can I nor do I want to make specific exceptions for just a few people. The mod's license permits you to remove any features you don't want for your own build (and I know modding is hard, that's why I won't do this for you!)

<p>Better HUD gives you heaps of customization options for the in-game HUD: move around vanilla widgets, add or remove new widgets, and configure it all to your liking! Better HUD features a powerful positioning system to get everything just right, and plenty of tweaks for each widget.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>To open the settings menu, the default key binding is <strong>U</strong>. This can be changed just like any other key, from <strong>Options... Controls... Miscellaneous</strong>. From the menu you have control over everything on screen, down to the crosshair. Enable or disable widgets, or click the options button for more options and positioning.</p>

<h2>Configure Vanilla</h2>
<p>In <strong>beta-1.4</strong> and later (check the CurseForge project page!), vanilla elements can be moved and configured. Move around your hotbar, your health and hunger bars, and everything else. You can even turn off your health bar for extra-hard mode!</p>

<h2>Widgets</h2>
<p>Better HUD has a grand total of <strong>40</strong> configurable widgets. There's an on-screen compass, armor status, item pickup tracker, blood splatters and many more. Mix and match to create your perfect HUD. Check the full list below:</p>
